# web-package-start-kit

This repository is the reimplementation of project [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/).

This demo project has the following characters:

- Use the backbone framework
- Use the `CMD` management pattern, to make the project clear and easy-understanding.

## Local Setup

- Install the dependencies with `npm install`
- Build with `gulp`
- Run tests `gulp test`
- Run tests in watch mode `gulp test-watch`

## Local Run

Run command `gulp` in `examples/` directory, then the server will run in the local host.
You can launch the browser and open the URL "http://localhost:8080/" to see what the web component looks like.
